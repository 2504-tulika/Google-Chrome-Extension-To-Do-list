Sounds cool!! Isn't it!?
Here I have tried to create a Google Chrome Extension for To Do List to keep record of our To Do's. 

## Overview
This Extension will help to keep track of our To Do's and after completion we can tick the check box and strike it off from the list and add many more whenever needed.

## Manual Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
3. Enable Developer Mode using the toggle in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
## Hola Developers!!
Feel free to customize this template to fit the specific details and needs of your Google Chrome extension. Providing clear and concise instructions in your README file to make it easier for users and developers to understand, use extension.
